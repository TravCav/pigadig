Entity
    creatures can collect items over time from killing other things 
        an entity may or may not have the skill to do things like breakdown or sell.
        if an enemy eats another entity. those entity's dropitems/inventory now become drop items. 
        upon killing something the creature can have different methods of "looting" via eating or collecting
        does pooing drop them?  probably in some future version.
    actions need to be learned
        can we add them to the class at runtime?
